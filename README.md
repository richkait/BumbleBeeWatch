a Responsive WordPress Child Theme

This repo contains the WP install for BBW, currently in development. The BBW folder should be placed in the .htdocs folder.
Additionally, the SQL file needs to be imported into the DB, etc. to set up this install.
This install has been passed on to the developer to hook it up and make the magic happen!

So, as you might of guessed, this website currently does nothing and this theme is probably not useful to you, the general public.
But, here it is, for prosperity :D
